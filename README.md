Buddy is a persistent AI learning companion built for people who learn constantly and are tired of losing context between sessions. Think opencode, but purpose-built for learning.

## The Problem

Most AI tools treat every learning session as a blank slate. You spend the first 10 minutes re-explaining what you've been studying, where you left off, and what you already know. Progress lives in your head (or a scattered collection of markdown files you're manually updating). There's no system that actually knows what you've learned and what's next.

## What Buddy Does

Buddy maintains your learning context across sessions so you can pick up exactly where you left off — no setup, no re-explaining yourself.

- **Persistent context** — Buddy remembers what you've studied, what clicked, and what didn't, across every session
- **Progress tracking** — See where you are in a topic and what you should tackle next
- **Learning-first conversation** — Buddy engages with you like a learning partner: asking questions, generating exercises, and adapting to how you're doing
- **Automatic notes** — Session summaries and key insights are saved automatically so your learning artifacts stay up to date
- **Next topic suggestions** — Based on what you've covered, Buddy surfaces what to explore next

## Who It's For

Buddy is for self-directed learners who study regularly and want a tool that grows with them — not one that forgets them the moment the session ends.
